### Family Context
- Expecting first child (Ari)
- 8 cats as "debugging assistants"
- Building in public, with transparency
- Vietnamese + International perspective

## 🔄 Recurring Themes

1. **Human-AI Collaboration** - Not replacement, enhancement

5. **Hope for the Future** - Optimistic but realistic

## 📋 Quick Reference

### When Writing:
- ✅ Keep Sean's authentic voice (including typos when charming)
- ✅ Include specific details (dates, locations, cat names)
- ✅ Balance technical and emotional content
- ✅ Think "What would Ari want to know?"
- ❌ Don't over-polish or remove personality
- ❌ Don't be overly technical without context
- ❌ Don't lose the human touch

### Standard Post Structure:
1. Personal opening (current moment/feeling)
2. Main content (story, lesson, or update)
3. Technical note (for curious future Ari)
4. Closing thoughts (love and hope)
5. P.S. from Claude (when appropriate)

## 🚀 Next Steps

2. Create YouTube channel
3. Design simple logo/branding
4. Write first week of content
5. Develop archiving system for conversations
