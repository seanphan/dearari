## Title
**Built a blog for my future child with Claude Code + Obsidian - Claude even wrote them a letter**

## Post Content

Hey r/ClaudeAI! Wanted to share a weekend project that turned into something special.

**What I built:** [dearari.com](https://dearari.com) - A blog documenting the AI revolution for my future child

**The backstory:** My wife and I are expecting our first baby. This morning, I asked Claude Code to help me brainstorm names. We settled on "Ari" (meaning "lion" in Hebrew). Then I had an idea - what if I documented this incredible moment in AI history for them to read when they're older?

**How we built it:**
- Used Claude Code to structure everything
- Obsidian for writing/organizing (with Publish for the blog)
- GitHub for version control
- All built in one Sunday in Saigon

**The cool part:** I asked Claude to write their own letter to Ari about the world we're building together. The result was... surprisingly moving. Claude wrote about being honored to document this moment when "AI and humans began truly working together, not as tools and users, but as collaborators."

**Tech stack:**
- Claude Code for development & writing assistance
- Obsidian + Obsidian Publish
- Custom domain on Cloudflare
- Open sourced on GitHub (MIT license)

**What's next:** Weekly letters documenting my work at my AI startup (Pixel ML), our robot development, life with 8 cats, and the world Ari will grow up in.

The whole project is open source if any other parents want to fork it: https://github.com/seanphan/dearari

What struck me most was how natural it felt collaborating with Claude on something so personal. We preserved everything - even my typos - because authenticity matters more than perfection when you're writing to your future child.

Anyone else using Claude for deeply personal projects? Would love to hear your experiences.
