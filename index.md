*A father's letters to his future child about the AI revolution*

---

Welcome to a unique experiment in love, technology, and time travel.

I'm [Sean](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanp-ai/), founder of [Pixel ML](https://pixelml.com), and together with my wife [Leona](https://www.linkedin.com/in/uyenlepp/) (our lioness), we're writing letters to our future child, Ari (our little lion), documenting the incredible moment in history we're living through - the birth of artificial general intelligence, the rise of collaborative AI, and the world we're building for the next generation.

## What You'll Find Here

### üìù [Weekly Letters](/Blog%20Posts/Dear%20Ari%20Letters)
Every Sunday from Ho Chi Minh City, I write to Ari about what we're building, what we're learning, and how the world is changing. These aren't just technical updates - they're love letters to the future.

### ü§ñ [Robot Diary](/Blog%20Posts/Robot%20Diary)
Follow the development of Ari's future robot companion, from first circuits to first steps. Written from the robot's perspective as it learns to navigate a house with 8 cats.

### üß† [Technical Deep Dives](/Blog%20Posts/Technical%20Deep%20Dives)
Complex AI concepts explained as if to a curious child. Because one day, that curious child will want to understand what Dad was building.

### üè† [Family Chronicles](/Blog%20Posts/Family%20Chronicles)
Life in an unusual household where cats debug code, robots learn empathy, and a baby will grow up thinking AI assistants are as natural as sunrise.

## Why This Exists

In 2025, we stand at an inflection point. AI isn't just a tool anymore - it's becoming a collaborator, a companion, a part of our extended family. I'm building this world at Pixel ML with products like AgenticFlow, but more importantly, I'm building it for Ari.

This blog is:
- A time capsule of the AI revolution
- A father's promise to build ethical technology
- A bridge between the world we're leaving and the one Ari will inherit
- Proof that the future of AI is being shaped by love, not fear
