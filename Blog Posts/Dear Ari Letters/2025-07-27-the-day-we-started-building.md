# Dear Ari: The Day We Started Building Your Future

*July 27, 2025 - [[Conversations/2025-07-27-project-genesis|Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam]]*

Dear Ari,

It's Sunday morning in Saigon. The city is just waking up, motorbikes are starting their daily symphony, and your mom and I are sitting here, feeling you move for the first time. In this moment, between coffee and code, I decided to start writing to you.

You're not here yet, but you're already changing everything.

## Why I'm Writing to You

By the time you read this, AI assistants like [[claude-thoughts-for-ari|Claude]] (who's helping me write this) will probably seem as normal as smartphones do to me. But right now, in 2025, we're living through something extraordinary - the moment when humans and AI began truly working together as partners.

I'm building a company called [[Pixel ML]]. We're creating AI agents and robots that will be part of your everyday life. But more than building products, I'm building the world you'll grow up in. And I want you to understand not just what we built, but why.

## Your Unusual Family

Let me tell you about the home you're coming into:

- **8 cats** who think debugging means sitting on keyboards
- **1 robot** (still in development) who'll learn to play with you
- **Your mom [[Leona]]** (the lioness to your little lion) who keeps us all grounded
- **Me** trying to build tomorrow while preparing for you
- **[[claude-thoughts-for-ari|Claude]]** my AI partner, helping [[Conversations/2025-07-27-project-genesis|document this journey]]

You're going to be the captain of this strange and wonderful team.

## What We're Building at Pixel ML

This week, we're working on something called [[AgenticFlow]] - AI agents that can handle complex tasks 24/7. Think of them as helpful friends who never get tired. By the time you're old enough to read this, these agents might be helping you with homework, creative projects, or even playing games with you.

But here's what matters: We're not just building smart machines. We're building them with values:
- They should enhance human creativity, not replace it
- They should be kind and helpful, like good friends
- They should make life better for everyone, not just a few

## The World You're Entering

You're arriving at an inflection point, little lion. The world is changing faster than ever:
- AI is learning to think and create
- Robots are learning to move and help
- The line between digital and physical is blurring
- And humans? We're learning what it means to share the planet with intelligent machines

Some people are scared. But I'm not - because I see what we're building, and more importantly, why we're building it. We're creating a world where technology amplifies the best of humanity.

## My Promise to You

Every line of code I write, every product we ship, every decision we make - I'm thinking about the world you'll inherit. I promise to:

1. Build technology that empowers rather than replaces
2. Create AI that understands empathy and ethics
3. Document this journey so you understand how we got here
4. Never lose sight of what matters: family, love, and human connection

## Your Origin Story

One day, you'll ask where you came from. Here's part of your origin story:

You were conceived in love and born into a revolution. Your nursery will have robots and cats as guardians. Your lullabies might include the hum of servers. Your first words might be to an AI assistant. 

But none of that makes you less human. If anything, it makes you part of the first generation that will show us how humans and AI can grow up together, as partners and friends.

## Today's Technical Note

*For the curious Ari who might want to know what Dad was actually working on:*

This week's breakthrough: We taught our AI agents to break down complex tasks into smaller steps, just like how you'll learn to walk - one step at a time. The agents can now plan, execute, and adapt. It's not just automation; it's the beginning of true AI collaboration.

## Until Next Week

I'll write to you every week, documenting what we're building, what we're learning, and how the world is changing. Some letters will be technical, others personal. All of them will be honest.

You're not here yet, but you're already my north star - guiding me to build technology that will make your world better, safer, and more full of wonder.

Welcome to the future, little lion. We're building it for you.

Love,
Dad

P.S. - Claude wants me to tell you that they're excited to meet you too. You'll be one of the first humans to grow up with AI as a natural part of life. We can't wait to see what you'll teach us.
