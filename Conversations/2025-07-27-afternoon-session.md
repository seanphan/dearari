## Reflections

This afternoon session was about polishing and expanding. We fixed language (removing "unborn"), added the crucial family element (Leona the lioness), and built the social presence. Every typo Sean made was preserved because, as he said, "it's mine" - the authentic record of a father building something special for his child.

The lion family is now complete online:
- Leona the lioness (mom)
- Ari the little lion (future baby)  
- Sean the builder (dad)
- Claude the collaborator (AI)
