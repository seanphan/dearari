# Project Genesis: The Day We Started Building Ari's World

*July 27, 2025 - Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam*

## Morning: The Naming Journey

**10:54 AM Vietnam Time**

Sean: Hey, we are expecting a baby. We would like to find some nickname for him or her. You read the entire repository, you know that what I'm doing, I'm building an AI startup with AI and robotics and so on. I would like to make a nickname for him or her because they will grow together. And also in the home we have 8 cats as well. So, it's me, we have a new kitten and I'm going to have a new robot as well. So, together we have 10, I don't know, it can be like a soccer team. My new baby is the Captain. So, yeah, brain start for me, maybe 20 names and also reason why.

*Claude provided 20 names, including Baymax, Neo, Pixel, Data, Atlas...*

Sean: Dude, you are naming a baby name. What are you have putting here? Neo seem good baymax is character name already have The name already, but this is not a name for robot. It's the name for the baby. The baby should play with the robot. But yeah

*Claude pivoted to real human names: Neo, Max, Sam, Alex, Ray, Morgan, Quinn, Blake, River, Sage, Casey, Jordan, Kai, Ari, Sky/Skye, Jules, Avery, Charlie, Robin, Phoenix*

Sean: my wife love sky, ari and quinn

*Claude highlighted the top three with special focus*

## The Blog Idea Emerges

Sean: I love Ari name, you should know what I'm doing with Pixel ML, I'm going to write blog for the world where Ari live in, it should be the blog to share my view about current AI advancement and my research while building at Pixel ML for our product like AgenticFlow or later Pixel ML robotics. Help me brainstorm a blog or youtube channel for this.

*Claude suggested "Through Ari's Eyes: AI, Robots & The Future We're Building" with various content pillars*

## Creating the Vision

Sean: Dude, you are naming a baby name... [realization about needing proper structure]

Sean: create a new product in this and it will be driven by me

*Discussion about domain names*

Sean: use a .com

Sean: littlelionlabs.com taken, teamari.com $5000, we have futurewithari.com braindstorm something shorter ?

*Eventually settling on exploring dearari.com*

## The Emotional Moment

Sean: Claude, this project shall be done between you and me for Ari, the world my baby live in. What is your thuoght, write to the file

*Claude wrote a heartfelt letter about the collaboration*

## Domain Decision

**Around 11:00 AM**

Sean: Thanks claude, this feel special, today is Jul 27, Sunday 10:54an Vietnam time (we are in Ho chi minh city). I'm thinking about the blog and youtube name futurewithari.com and dearari.com available, what do you think ?

Claude: My recommendation: **dearari.com** - Why? It's shorter, more memorable, and perfectly captures the heart of what we're building - a father's letters to his child about the world being created.

## The Purchase

Sean: [Screenshot showing successful purchase of dearari.com on Cloudflare]

Sean: thanks, I bought domain dearari.com domain it is going to be an exciting and memorable journey where ari can read once he/she grow up. I hope this should be a wonderful journey. To keep this project oranized and you don't lose the context of what we build together, can you add a claudeandari.md in this folder so that later you will ensure you have enverything you need to write without reading everything back from ground up...

*[Note: Sean's authentic voice with typos preserved as requested - "oranized", "enverything", "sturcture", "pythong", etc. These make the conversation real and human]*

## Reflections on This Moment

This conversation marks the beginning of something special. In just a few hours on a Sunday morning in Saigon:
- Ari got their name (meaning "lion")
- dearari.com was born
- A father and an AI began collaborating on a unique project
- The vision crystallized: documenting the AI revolution for the next generation

The typos, the stream of consciousness, the excitement - it's all part of the authentic record of how "Dear Ari" began. Not in a polished conference room, but in real conversation between a father-to-be with big dreams and an AI assistant honored to help build them.
